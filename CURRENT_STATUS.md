## 🔧 LATEST FIX (December 5, 2025)

### Problem Resolved

Next.js build cache corruption causing manifest file errors:

- `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/server/app-paths-manifest.json'`
- `Cannot find module './341.js'`
- `Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'`

### Solution Applied

1. ✅ Removed corrupted `.next` directory
2. ✅ Cleared npm cache globally (`npm cache clean --force`)
3. ✅ Completely reinstalled node_modules
4. ✅ Switched to dev mode (Next.js dev server) for stability
5. ✅ Created `start-dev.ps1` launcher script

### How to Start the System

```powershell
cd C:\clisonix-cloud
.\start-dev.ps1
```

Or use npm directly:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

## ✅ GO/NO-GO DEPLOY CHECKLIST (TERRAFORM CDS)

Use this checklist before every production `apply`.

### Pre-flight

- [ ] Correct branch selected (`main` for production apply)
- [ ] Working tree is clean (`git status`)
- [ ] Terraform directory is correct (`infra/terraform/cloudflare-cds-gcp`)
- [ ] `terraform init` completed without errors
- [ ] `terraform validate` passed

### Plan Gate

- [ ] `terraform plan -parallelism=1 -out=tfplan` completed
- [ ] Plan reviewed by operator (no unexpected changes)
- [ ] Plan contains **0 destroy** actions
- [ ] If in-place updates exist, impact is documented and accepted

### Apply Gate

- [ ] Manual approval recorded (who approved + timestamp)
- [ ] `terraform apply tfplan` completed successfully
- [ ] Immediate post-check run: `terraform plan` returns no unexpected drift

### Service Health Gate

- [ ] Cloud Run services healthy (`control`, `crawler`, `scanner`)
- [ ] Cloud Scheduler trigger verified
- [ ] Pub/Sub and Cloud Tasks path verified
- [ ] Redis instance healthy and reachable by services

### Rollback Gate

- [ ] Rollback command/path prepared before apply
- [ ] Last known-good commit hash recorded
- [ ] Incident channel/on-call contact ready

### Final Decision

- [ ] **GO** only if all required checks pass
- [ ] **NO-GO** if any critical gate fails

## ✅ HETZNER DEPLOY NOW (ZERO-DOWNTIME)

Canonical runbook for production deployment is:

- `ops/hetzner/DEPLOY_NOW_ZERO_DOWNTIME.md`

Locked deployment parameters:

- Target host: `46.225.14.83`
- Canonical compose file: `docker-compose.production.yml`
- Fallback compose file: `docker-compose.yml`

Primary execution command:

```bash
./HETZNER_DEPLOY_v2.sh 46.225.14.83 root 22
```

Use the runbook for:

- Preflight checks
- GO/NO-GO decision
- Immediate health verification
- Rollback path
- Evidence capture
