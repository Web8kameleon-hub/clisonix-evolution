# Ultra Algebra Spec (Aᴜ) — Formal Definition

## 1. Introduction
The Ultra Algebra (Aᴜ) defines the mathematical framework for operations within the Sovereign Nanogrid Fabric. It ensures deterministic, idempotent, and convergent behavior across distributed nodes, enabling self-healing and offline-tolerant computation.

## 2. Alphabet (Σᴜ)
The alphabet consists of 12 symbols, grouped into 3 levels:

### Level 1: Physical Ops
- 1: S (Store)
- 2: C (Compute)
- 3: R (Route)
- 4: E (Encrypt)

### Level 2: Structural Ops
- 5: P (Replicate)
- 6: M (Merge)
- 7: F (Fork)
- 8: J (Join)

### Level 3: Cognitive Ops
- 9: L (Learn)
- 10: D (Decide)
- 11: T (Transform)
- 12: X (Execute)

Each symbol maps to a numeric ID (1–12) in CBOR messages.

## 3. Algebraic Structure
Operations are composed using the composition operator ∘.

### 3.1 Associativity
For any ops a, b, c ∈ Σᴜ:
(a ∘ b) ∘ c = a ∘ (b ∘ c)

This allows reordering for optimization.

### 3.2 Idempotence
For store-like ops:
S ∘ S = S
P ∘ P = P
M ∘ M = M

Ensures safe retries and offline replay.

### 3.3 Branching and Joining
Fork: F(x) = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} where x is split into n branches.
Join: J({x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}) = x* where x* is the merged state.

Merge rules for conflicts: deterministic union or policy-based resolution.

### 3.4 Cognitive Extensions
Learn: L(x) updates a local model based on x.
Decide: D(x) = argmax_{p ∈ Policies} p(x), selecting the best policy.
Transform: T(x) evolves the schema of x.
Execute: X(x) runs a deterministic pipeline on x.

## 4. Convergence and Consistency
- Eventual consistency via idempotent ops and logical clocks.
- Conflict resolution: Algebraic merge ensures no data loss.
- Offline tolerance: Ops apply deterministically upon reconnection.

## 5. Implementation Notes
- In Rust: Use enums for ops, with match statements for application.
- CBOR serialization: Ops as arrays of u8 IDs.
- Verification: Formal proofs for associativity and idempotence.

This spec ensures the fabric operates as a mathematical organism, not a traditional system.
